# Escape Room Text Game

## Project Overview
This is a text-based escape room game implemented in C++. The game demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and polymorphism. Players navigate through different rooms, each with unique descriptions and actions, to ultimately escape.

## Features
- **Rooms**: Each room (`Cell`, `Hallway`, `Cave`) has its own description and set of actions.
- **Inventory Management**: Players can collect and inspect items (minimal use now but will add to in future).
- **Clues**: Players receive clues to help them progress through the game.
- **Polymorphism**: The game uses virtual functions and overridden methods to implement room-specific behaviors.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Polymorphism**
- **CMAKE**
- **Batch Files**
