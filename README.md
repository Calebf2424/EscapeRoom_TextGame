# Escape Room Text Game

## Project Overview
This is a text-based escape room game implemented in C++. The game demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and polymorphism. Players navigate through different rooms, each with unique descriptions and actions, to ultimately escape.

## Features

- **Inventory Management**: Players can collect and inspect items that are required to help them advance.
- **Clues**: Players receive clues to help them progress through the game.
- **Polymorphism**: The game uses virtual functions and overridden methods to implement room-specific behaviors.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Polymorphism**
- **CMAKE**
